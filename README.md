Harris said, however, that the river would suit him to a "T."  I don't 
know what a "T" is (except a sixpenny one, which includes breadand
butter and cake AD LIB., and is cheap at the price, if you haven't had 
any dinner).  It seems to suit everybody, however, which is greatly to 
its credit.

It suited me to a "T" too, and Harris and I both said it was a good idea 
of George's; and we said it in a tone that seemed to somehow imply that 
we were surprised that George should have come out so sensible.

The only one who was not struck with the suggestion was Montmorency.  He 
never did care for the river, did Montmorency.

"It's all very well for you fellows," he says; "you like it, but I don't.  
There's nothing for me to do.  Scenery is not in my line, and I don't 
smoke.  If I see a rat, you won't stop; and if I go to sleep, you get 
fooling about with the boat, and slop me overboard.  If you ask me, I 
call the whole thing bally foolishness."

We were three to one, however, and the motion was carried.
